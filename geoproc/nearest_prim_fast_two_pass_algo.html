        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>AABB</b>: Axis-Aligned Bounding Box</li>
            <li><b>BVH</b>: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</li>
            <li>
                <b>Distance(point, AABB)</b>: Zero if point is inside AABB,
                otherwise it is the distance to nearest point on AABB surface
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Inputs:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Q</b>: Query point</li>
            <li><b>AABB_Tree</b>: BVH of AABBs of some set of primitives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <h3>First Pass (a greedy nearest primitive pass):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We traverse the tree only picking the closest AABB</li>
            <li>
                Once leaf node is reached, iterate its child primitives and
                record the nearest one to the query point
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Second Pass (a "nearest primitive in range" pass):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Traverse tree and discard AABBs that have distance greater than
                distance to primitive found in first pass
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep record of nearest primitive found in leaf nodes while
                traversing
            </li>
            <li>
                Nearest found primitive is the absolute nearest primitive to the
                query point
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why is a second pass needed?</h3>
        <p>
            First pass is not enough to find nearest primitive, picking nearest
            AABB while traversing indeed is the best way to find true nearest
            primitive,
        </p>
        <p>
            but it only guarantees finding a possible nearest primitive, not the
            true one, because when the nearest AABB is picked, we essentially
            pick the AABB where the nearest possible primitive in that AABB is
            closer than the other AABB,
        </p>
        <p>
            but when we finally find the actual nearest primitive in the final
            AABB tree leaf node, the only way for it to be the true nearest is
            for it to have the same distance to the query point as that very
            first distance to AABB in the very first traversal step, if distance
            is greater than that very first distance, or if that very first
            distance was zero, a second pass is needed, so we do it every time
            anyways, a "nearest primitive in range" query, where the range is
            the distance found in first pass,
        </p>
        <p>
            we of course do not have to check primitives that are further away
            from query point than the primitive found in first pass (that's why
            we discard AABBs that have distance greater than distance to
            primitive found in first pass), because by definition, nearest
            primitive is closer than any other primitive in the set, so for
            every primitive in set, the nearest primitive has to be either
            closer or equal in distance than it, this an obvious but subtle fact
            worth mentioning if we ever wanted to prove the algorithm formally.
